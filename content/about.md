Christophe Gyurgyik (or simply, Chris) is a PhD candidate at Stanford University advised by [Fred Kjolstad][fkjolstad]. His interests include programming language and compiler design. His current work focuses on developing abstractions that enable the performance engineer (read: computer science expert) to optimize data structures while preserving productivity for the application user (read: non computer science expert). 

Previously, he worked at Google on the [XLA][] (Accelerated Linear Algebra) compiler and the [TPU][] (Tensor Processing Unit). Prior to industry, his research centered on [Calyx][], a compiler infrastructure for languages that target hardware accelerators and [CIRCT][], an experimental compiler to improve hardware design tools. This work was completed under Cornell University's [CAPRA][], spearheaded by [Rachit Nigam][rnigam] and [Adrian Sampson][asampson].

In his free time, Christophe enjoys [climbing][mountain-project], surfing, and reading.
