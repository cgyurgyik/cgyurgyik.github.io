Christophe Gyurgyik is a PhD candidate at Stanford University. His interests include languages (programming and natural), compilers, and hardware-software codesign. 

Previously, he worked at Google on the [XLA][] (Accelerated Linear Algebra) compiler and the [TPU][] (Tensor Processing Unit). Prior to industry, his researched focused on [Calyx][], a compiler infrastructure for languages that target hardware accelerators. This led to further collaboration with [CIRCT][], an experimental compiler to improve hardware design tools. The work was completed under Cornell University's [CAPRA][], spearheaded by [Adrian Sampson][asampson] and [Rachit Nigam][rnigam].

In his free time, Christophe enjoys speaking natural languages (French and Italian) and rock climbing. A recent memorable adventure was the [Tuolumne Triple Crown][triple-crown].
